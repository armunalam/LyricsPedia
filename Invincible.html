Invincible... Invincible...
You make me feel so...

I'm tryin to get through
So I can be with you
I'm powerless without you and weak
Cuz I need energy that you give me
I'm holdin out my arms 
Hopin you're not far
Cuz everything I dreamed of you are
You are
You're a wish upon a star

Pre hook-
I can fly
Move things with my mind
Disappear when I feel like
Anything that I try
When I'm with you

Hook:
I feel invincible
Put me on the front line
Invincible...
Like I can stop time
Invincible...
As long as I've got you, you you...
I feel invincible
Like I can stop a bullet
Invincible...
Yeah anything I can do it
Invincible...
As long as I've got you, you you...

Verse 2:
I don't wanna come down
I'm at the speed of sound
It's only been a minute
To me, to me
And I'm where I wanna be

Pre hook-
I can fly
Move things with my mind
Disappear when I feel like
Anything that I try
When I'm with you

Hook:
I feel invincible
Put me on the front line
Invincible...
Like I can stop time
Invincible...
As long as I've got you, you you...
I feel invincible
Like I can stop a bullet
Invincible...
Yeah anything I can do it
Invincible...
As long as I've got you, you you...

I feel invincible...
