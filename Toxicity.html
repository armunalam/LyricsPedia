Conversion, software version 7.0 
looking at life through the eyes of a tired hub 
eating seeds as a pastime activity 
the toxicity of our city, of our city 
Now, what do you own the world? 
how do you own disorder, disorder 
Now somewhere between the sacred silence 
Sacred silence and sleep 
somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep 
disorder, disorder, disorder 
More wood for the fires, loud neighbours 
flashlight riveries caught in the headlights of a truck 
eating seeds as a pastime activity 
the toxicity of our city, of our city 

Now, what do you own the world? 
how do you own disorder, disorder 
Now somewhere between the sacred silence 
Sacred silence and sleep 
somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep 
disorder, disorder, disorder 
Now, what do you own the world? 
how do you own disorder, disorder 
Now somewhere between the sacred silence 
Sacred silence and sleep 
somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep 
disorder, disorder, disorder 
When I became the sun 
I shone life into the man's hearts 
When I became the sun 
I shone life into the man's hearts
