(Round & Round)
Round & Round
Round & Round
Round & Round

You see me standing there
And act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me

Oh why you always make me feel
Like I'm the one that's crazy
You feel my heart racing
My, my heart racing

[Chorus:]
Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say
We're going round & round
We're never gonna stop going round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

You come to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I've cried out all my tears
I push my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Bring them back
Now you got me singing

[Chorus]

Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop [x2]

[Chorus]

We're never gonna stop going
Round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh
