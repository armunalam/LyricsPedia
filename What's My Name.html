[Rihanna]
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

[Drake]
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 some, right
'cause I've been tryna work it out, oooow
Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Oh, let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You're just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, it's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gonna say

[Rihanna]
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy, you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge, let's explore your talent

[Chorus x2:]
Hey boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you 'cause you just my type
Oh na na na na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put you work up
Oh, oh

Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

[Rihanna]
Baby, you got me, ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in

[Chorus]

You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You about to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

[Chorus 2x]
