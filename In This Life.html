I was nurtured, I was sheltered
I was curious and young
I was searching for that something
Trying to find it on the run

Oh, and just when I stopped looking
I saw just how far I'd come
In this life, in this life

You give me love, you give me light
Show me everything's been happening
I've opened up my eyes, I'm following

Three steps fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In this life
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I have faltered, I have stumbled
I have found my feet again
I've been angry and I've been shaken
Found a new place to begin

And my persistence to make a difference
Has led me safe into your hands
In this life, in this life

You give me love, you give me light
Show me everything's been happening
I've opened up my eyes, I'm following

Three steps fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was put here for a reason
I was born into this world
And I'm living and I'm believing
That I was meant to be your girl
In this life, in this life

You give me love, you give me light
Show me everything's been happening
I've opened up my eyes, I'm following

Three steps fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life

Three steps fight an honest fight
Two hearts that can start a fire
One love is all I need in this life

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In this life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In this life

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
