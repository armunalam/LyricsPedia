Don't stop, don't stop! We're in luck now!
Don't stop, there's so much to be found!
We can find paradise,
All we have to do is go! Go! Free your soul.
Mysteries abound in this world that we will see (that we will see).
Foes all around, But I will go fearless and free.
I'll give you strength, You give me love. That's how we'll live. (that's how we'll live)
Courage won't fade. If you're with me, my enemies can never win.

We will fight for love and glory. We will live to tell the story.
There is nothing we can't live through – Nothing ever dies; we will rise again.

Don't stop, don't stop! We're in luck now!
Don't stop, keep your spirit proud.
And ride upon the wind
All we have to do is go!

Don't stop, don't stop! We're in luck now!
Don't stop, there's so much to be found.
We can find paradise.
All we have to do is go! Go! Free your soul.
Dragon Soul!
